## Other Docs
The docs folder contains a bunch of guides intended to be read by developers. These docs may occasionally contain example API calls.

## Api Docs
The api-docs currently contains docs that are used on [https://www.stellar.org/api/](https://www.stellar.org/api/). `convert.js` is used to compile all the XML into a HTML page (`api-docs.html`). It will be refactored in the future to use Markdown and be human readable.

## Contributing
Contributers are more than welcome here. We chose to use GitHub to have an organized way to collaborate. To contribute, create a new branch and then submit a pull request when you're done. Someone on the team will then review it and comment on it and/or pull in the changes.

- If you write a new part of the docs, we will be happy to pull it in if it's good.
- To make small contributions, you can just go into the file (using the GitHub website) and edit a file and submit a pull request.
- To request documentation to be written about something, feel free to open an issue.
