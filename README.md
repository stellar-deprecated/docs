Stellar Docs
============

This repository is home to the Stellar documentation.

## Gateway Docs
* [Introduction to Stellar Gateways](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/docs/gateways.md)
* [Stellar.txt](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/docs/stellar-txt.md)
* [Federation](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/docs/federation.md)

## Other Docs

The docs folder contains guides intended to be read by developers. These docs may occasionally contain example API calls.
* [Client Tutorial](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/docs/how-to-build-a-client.md) - explains how to build a Stellar web client app from beginning to end.
* The [old-docs folder](https://github.com/stellar/docs/tree/master/old-docs) contains unmaintained or deprecated documents.

## API Docs

The api-docs currently contains docs that are used on [https://www.stellar.org/api/](https://www.stellar.org/api/). `convert.js` is used to compile all the XML into a HTML page (`api-docs.html`). It will be refactored in the future to use Markdown and be human readable.
