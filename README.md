Stellar Docs
============

This repository is home to the Stellar documentation. These docs feed into the [Stellar developers site builder](https://github.com/stellar/developers) and are on display at [stellar.org/developers](https://www.stellar.org/developers/).

## How to write docs

There are a few conventions when writing docs that go into the Stellar Developers site. Most of the docs are written in Markdown format. For an introduction to Markdown, take a look at [Github's Mastering Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Headers

Lines that start with a hash symbol (`#`) are considered headers. Below is an example of a few and the name of the header:

```
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
```

- DO NOT use h1 since that is reserved for the page title generated from front matter.
- DO NOT skip a header size (don't go from h2 to h4).
- DO use smaller headers (more hash symbols) to represent that a section is nested under a parent one with a larger header.
- DO add a space after the hash symbols. Some Markdown parsers will not render the text as a header without the space.

### Front matter

At the top of most documents is something called "front matter". This is metadata for the file written in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

Here is an example of front matter in action:
```
---
title: Horizon Reference
---
```

The currently used keys in the front matter are:
- title

### Document title

Do not start a page with a Markdown header (`# Title`). Instead, leave it in the front matter. The developers site will take the title from the front matter.

### Links

Use inline links and not reference links.

There are three different kinds of links, and each different kind of link has a significant meaning. Some of these links are transformed in the generation of the developers site.

      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>cross repository links (should link to the dev portal at www.stellar.org/developers/)</li>
          <li>links to external sites (like https://www.google.com/)</li>
        </ul>

      <td>https://www.stellar.org/developers/js-stellar-base/learn/building-transactions.html</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Non-markdown files

Sometimes we want to include other types of content such as `.pdf`'s. To add front matter to the PDF, create a sibling file with the PDF file name and an added extension of `.metadata`. This file can then define metadata for the title of the `.pdf`.

An example can be seen in [stellar-core's software folder](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/tree/master/docs/software).
