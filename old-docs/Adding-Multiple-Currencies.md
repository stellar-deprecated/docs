Adding a new currency to your account.
=======================================

* A [gateway](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/old-docs/gateway-introduction.md) is any network participant you trust to accept a deposit in exchange for credit on the network. 
* To transact in other currencies on Stellar, you need to add a gateway to your account. (You will need to use the full name of the gateway including the top-level domain such as .com, .co, .org)
* Once you have added a gateway, you can send and receive the currencies supported by the gateway.
* Adding a gateway also extends [trust lines](https://github.com/stellar/docs/blob/master/old-docs/Gateway-Guide.md#trust-lines) to it. 
* Here's [a list of community-contributed gateways](gateway-list.md) issuing credit on the Stellar network, and they offer different ways of accepting deposits in various currencies. Please do your own research in deciding if you want to transact with a gateway.
