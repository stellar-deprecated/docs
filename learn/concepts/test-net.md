title: Testnet
---

The testnet is a small test Stellar network, open to developers.

Stellar.org runs 3 stellar-core validators on this test network. Set your stellar-core to connect to us by using this [configuration](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg). You can also find a [Horizon instance](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/) that is connected to the testnet.

The testnet is for, well, testing. It's occasionally reset, so don't get attached to any balances or accounts that you have on it.
