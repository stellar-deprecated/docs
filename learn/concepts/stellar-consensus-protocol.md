title: Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)
---


The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions. SCP has a set of provable safety properties that optimize for safety over livenessâ€”in the event of partition or misbehaving nodes, it halts progress of the network until consensus can be reached. SCP simultaneously enjoys four key properties: decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.

A few ways to explore SCP:
* To learn all about the protocol, read the [white paper](https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol.pdf). 
* View or contribute to the code in [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core).
* If white papers aren't your thing, here's a [technical summary](https://medium.com/a-stellar-journey/on-worldwide-consensus-359e9eb3e949). 
* If your new to consensus, get the basics from our graphic novel, [Adventures in Galactic Consensus](https://www.stellar.org/stories/adventures-in-galactic-consensus-chapter-1/).
