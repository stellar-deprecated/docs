title: Testnet
---

The testnet is a small test Stellar network, run by the Stellar Development
Foundation (SDF), which is open to developers.

SDF runs 3 Stellar Core validators on the testnet.

You can connect a node to the testnet by configuring [stellar-core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core) to use this
[configuration](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/docs/stellar-core_testnet.cfg).

There is also a [Horizon instance](https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/) that
can directly interact with the testnet.

## What is the Stellar testnet good for?

* [Creating test accounts](../get-started/create-account.md) (with funding thanks to Friendbot).
* Developing applications and exploring tutorials on Stellar without the
  potential to lose any valuable [assets](assets.md).
* Test existing applications against new releases or release candidates of
  [Stellar Core](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) and [Horizon](https://github.com/stellar/go/releases).
* Perform data analysis on a smaller, non-trivial data set compared to the public network.

## What is the Stellar testnet not good for?

* Load and stress testing.
  * If you want to test for performance, a good place to
    get started is by taking a look at
    [Stellar Core's core performance document](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/performance-eval.md#networks-to-test-against).
* High availability test infrastructure - SDF makes no guarantees around the
  availability of the testnet.
* Long term storage of data on the network - [the network is ephemeral, and resets perodically](test-net.md#periodic-reset-of-testnet-data).
* Your testing infrastructure requires more control over the test environment,
  such as:
  * The ability to set the data reset frequency.
  * The need to secure private or sensitive data (before launching on the public network)

Keep in mind that you can always run your own test network for use cases that
don't work well with SDF's testnet.

## Best Practices For Using Testnet

### Periodic Reset of Testnet Data
In order to preserve a good experience for developers, the SDF testnet is
periodically reset to the genesis (initial) ledger. This ensures the removal of
spam, minimizing the time to catch up to the latest ledger, and easier
maintenance of the system over time.

When this happens, all ledger entries (such as accounts, trustlines, offers,
etc), transactions, and historical data are cleared for both Stellar Core and
Horizon.

As a result, developers should not rely on the existence of any accounts, or
the state of any balances within testnet.

### Test Data Automation

Since most applications rely on data being present to do anything useful, it is
highly recommended that you have testing infrastructure that can repopulate
testnet with useful data after a reset. Not only will this make testing more
reliable, but it will also help you scale out your testing infrastructure to
a private test network if you choose to do so.

For example:
* Generating issuers of assets for testing the development of a wallet.
* Generating orders on the order book (both current and historical) for testing
  the development of a trading client.

As a maintainer of an application, you will want to think about creating a data
set that is representative enough to test your primary use cases, and allow for
robust testing even when testnet is not available.

A script can automate this entire process by [creating an account with
Friendbot](../get-started/create-account.md), and submitting a set of
[transactions](transactions.md) that are predefined as a part of
your testing infrastructure.
